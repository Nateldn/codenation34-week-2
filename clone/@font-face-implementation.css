/* Web Fonts Using @font-face
Fonts can also be added using a @font-face ruleset in your CSS stylesheet instead of using a <link> element in your HTML document. As mentioned earlier, fonts can be downloaded just like any other file on the web. They come in a few different file formats, such as:

OTF (OpenType Font)
TTF (TrueType Font)
WOFF (Web Open Font Format)
WOFF2 (Web Open Font Format 2)
The different formats are a progression of standards for how fonts will work with different browsers, with WOFF2 being the most progressive. It’s a good idea to include TTF, WOFF, and WOFF2 formats with your @font-face rule to ensure compatibility on all browsers.

@font-face {
    font-family: 'MyParagraphFont', sans-serif;
    src: url('fonts/Roboto.woff2') format('woff2'),
         url('fonts/Roboto.woff') format('woff'),
         url('fonts/Roboto.ttf') format('truetype');
  }
  @font-face {
    font-family: 'GlegooBanner', sans-serif;
    src: url('fonts/Glegoo-Regular.woff2') format('woff2'),
         url('fonts/Glegoo-Regular.woff') format('woff'),
         url('fonts/Glegoo-Regular.ttf') format('truetype');
  }

  Let’s take a look at the example above, line by line:
  
  The @font-face at-rule is used as the selector. It’s recommended to define the @font-face ruleset at the top of your CSS stylesheet.
  Inside the declaration block, the font-family property is used to set a custom name for the downloaded font. The name can be anything you choose, but it must be surrounded by quotation marks. In the example, the font is named 'MyParagraphFont', as this font will be used for all paragraphs.
  The src property contains three values, each specifying the relative path to the font file and its format. In this example, the font files are stored inside a folder named fonts within the working directory.
  Once the @font-face at-rule is defined, you can use the font in your stylesheet!
